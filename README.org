Convert Jupyter Notebooks to Org

This is a python script to convert Jupyter notebooks to Org format.
Run as follows:

#+begin_example
jupyter2org.py Week_4.ipynb > Week_4.org
#+end_example

It presently exports Jupyter code cells as ob-python org babel blocks
(see https://github.com/gregsexton/ob-ipython) and handles minimal
markdown to org conversion of text blocks.
